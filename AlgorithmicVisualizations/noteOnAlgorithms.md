# Algorithms:

- **Insertion Sort**:   
    This is basically the card game:  
    Insertion Sort builds a sorted section of the array one element at a time by "inserting" each new element into its correct position within the sorted portion.  
    Best for small or nearly sorted data.

    Best Case: O(n), when the array is already sorted.
    Average Case: O(n^2), when the elements are in random order.
    Worst Case: O(n^2), when the elements are sorted in reverse.

- **Bubble Sort**:  
    This is like rearranging the cards everytime you pick a card instead of just placing in correct place:  
    Very Inefficient: Loops over the array everytime.

    Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if theyâ€™re in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

    Best Case: O(n), when the array is already sorted.
    Average Case: O(n^2), when the elements are in random order.
    Worst Case: O(n^2), when the elements are sorted in reverse.
